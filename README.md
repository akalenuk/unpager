unpager
=======

Image processing and transformation tool oriented towards printed matherial scans and pictures enchancing.

For now I have few features working:

![screenshot](/screenshots/before_proj.png "Before projection") → ![screenshot](/screenshots/after_proj.png "After projection")

![screenshot](/screenshots/before_flat.png "Before адфеуттштп") → ![screenshot](/screenshots/after_flat.png "After flattening")

![screenshot](/screenshots/before_darn.png "Before darning") → ![screenshot](/screenshots/after_darn.png "After darning")

**As for July 2016**, the project is abandoned. I tried to extract any useful math from it to reimplement in c++, and some code was reused in python programs. But as a desktop application it is done.

Here's the release: https://github.com/akalenuk/unpager/releases/tag/0.1

I also have a GIMP script for darning: https://github.com/akalenuk/darning

And also Android application for projections: https://github.com/akalenuk/Docam
